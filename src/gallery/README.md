# Examples

Most of the examples are broken right now, here are the working ones:

- [Hello World](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/0_helloWorld.l1)
- [Intro](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/1_intro.l1)
- [Gallery of Activation Functions](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/3_gallery.l1)
- [Closures](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/21_closures.l1)
- [Range](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/26_range.l1)
- [Logo](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/16_logo.l1)
- [Nested](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/src/gallery/17_nested.l1)

But see the broken ones for some *really cool shit*. Due to rewrite of the interpreter, it will take some time to get them working again.

Meanwhile, PRs are welcome, code is horrible and you have been warned! :)
