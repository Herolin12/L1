# TODO

## Demos

1. Gallery of Activation Functions
    * Needed functions (with docs):
        1. RandomNormal, RandomUniform
        2. RectifiedLinearUnit
        3. ExponentialLinearUnit
        4. Sine, Cosine
        6. Logarithm
    * Opportunity for implementing #doc?
        * add strings to grammar/sematics/interpreter

## Usefulness

1. Make work all demos so far.

## Wholeness

1. Router
    * Must be hierarchical
        * I don't know what that means right now.
        * Can target part of the "notebook"?
    * http://mlajtos.github.com/L1/~ii1jcLg-eIQ

## UX

1. Correspondence between code and visualization
    * Focus
        * What part of visualization was generated by which part of the code?
        * What code generates which part of the visualization?
    * mockup would help and can be a good start
