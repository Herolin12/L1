# TODO

## Demos

1. Gallery of Activation Functions
    * Needed functions (with docs):
        1. RandomNormal, RandomUniform
        2. RectifiedLinearUnit
        3. ExponentialLinearUnit
        4. Sine, Cosine
        6. Logarithm
    * Opportunity for implementing #doc?
        * add strings to grammar/sematics/interpreter

## Wholeness

1. Router
    * Must be hierarchical
        * I don't know what that means right now.
        * Can target part of the "notebook"?
    * http://mlajtos.github.com/L1/~ii1jcLg-eIQ
1. Database
    * probably FireBase with Cloud Functions

## UX

1. Correspondence between code and visualization
    * Focus
        * What part of visualization was generated by which part of the code?
        * What code generates which part of the visualization?
    * mockup would help and can be a good start

1. When there is a error, selection is not visible.
    * clashes with more than one error on the line
1. Broken visual cue for scrolling the board.
1. Visualization for empty tensor
1. Syntax-highlighting for markdown

## Crazy

 1. Name resolution
    * Capitalized names could be resolved from root
    * Capitalized names could be resolved by abbreviations (as in Moniel)

## Random
    * allow ! and () as a lamda argument?
