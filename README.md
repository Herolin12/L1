# L1: Tensor Studio

[L1: Tensor Studio](https://mlajtos.github.io/L1/latest/) is a live-programming environment for differentiable tensor computations. Think *playground for tensors*!

## ⚠️ Notice

- L1 is meant to provide a bridge for programmers that are transitioning to the field of functional differentiable programming.

- L1 is *NOT* meant as a replacement for real-world programming languages (Python, Scala, ...) or runtimes (Tensorflow, Caffe, ...)

- Have fun :)
