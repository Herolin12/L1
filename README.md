## About

L1 is a playground for differentiable linear algebra, heavily used in Machine Learning. This project is a combination of a programming language, interpreter, standard library and IDE in one unified experience.

### Goal

Become the standard tool for prototyping new Machine Learning ideas. [More...](GOAL.md)

### Features
* designed for rapid learning and prototyping
* live visualization
* elegant functional language
* eager execution
* auto-broadcast for tensor operations
* GPU-accelerated calculations
* awesome built-in documentation
* syntax-highlightning and code-completion

### Issues
* None of the mobile browsers are supported
* Firefox is rather slow and has unpredictable behavior, please use Chrome instead ([#3](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/issues/3))

### What's comming?
* variable tensors and optimization
* richer set of operators
* pre-trained models
* loading data, I/O
* [etc.](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/blob/master/TODO.md)

### Contribution

Any form of help and feedback is welcome. Including [PRs](CONTRIBUTING.md), [reporting bugs](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/issues/new), [suggesting ideas](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/issues/new), promotion,  etc.
