## About

L1 is a playground for differentiable linear algebra, heavily used in Machine Learning. This project is a combination of a programming language, interpreter, standard library and IDE in one unified experience.

### Goal

Become the standard tool for prototyping new Machine Learning ideas.

### Features
* designed for rapid learning and prototyping
* live visualization
* elegant functional language
* eager execution
* auto-broadcast for tensor operations
* GPU-accelerated computation
* awesome built-in documentation
* syntax-highlightning and code-completion

### Coming Soon
* variable tensors and optimisation
* richer set of tensor operators
* pre-trained models
* loading data
* etc.

### Issues
* Firefox is rather slow and has unpredictable behavior, please use Chrome instead

**Note:** This project is still under-developed. Help and/or feedback is welcome. [Create new issue.](https://github.com/mlajtos/L1/issues/new)
