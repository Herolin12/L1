# L1: Tensor Studio
[L1: Tensor Studio](https://mlajtos.github.io/L1/latest/) is a live-programming environment for differentiable tensor computations. Think *playground for tensors*!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

- This project is still under-developed. Any feedback is welcome.

- L1 is for experienced programmers who are transitioning to the field of functional differentiable programming. And also for everybody else. üôÇ

- L1 is **NOT** a replacement for any:
    - programming language ‚Äì Python, Scala, Julia, ...
    - runtime ‚Äì Tensorflow, Caffe, PyTorch, ...
    - IDE ‚Äì VSCode, Jupyter, Vim, ...

    It's something completely different.

- Have fun :)
